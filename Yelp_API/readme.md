# Analyzing restaurants in Columbus, Ohio
To view the project, you can either open the `.ipynb` files (if you have
Jupyter) located in the `full_project` directory or open the `.pdf` files in
this directory. I recommend starting with Token_Acquisition, then
Data_Acquisition, then Data_Analysis.

If you are only interested in the source code of the project, without its
output and visualizations, you can view `yelpAPI.py` (but it won't run correctly
since you don't have our keychain â€” viewing the `.ipynb` will display the
correct output since I have included the .ipynb checkpoints).

In order to replicate the results of this program or make modifications, it is
necessary to have a Yelp developer account and a keychain for it. It is also
possible the Yelp API will change over time and that this code may no longer
work with their latest API.
