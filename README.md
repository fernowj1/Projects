# Class Projects by John Fernow
This repo contains various class projects that I've had. All are projects
where we were given some creative freedom, and the professors change the
requirements a little each semester, so students shouldn't be able to cheat
using this repo. However, hopefully it can be a useful resource for those
wanting to better understand the languages and frameworks used in these
projects.

## [*Simon* (Arduino remake)](Arduino_Simon/)
A recreation of the famous 1970's game using an Arduino. Written in **C++**.   

## [Analyzing Kiva](Kiva/)
An analysis of an international nonprofit attempting to alleviate poverty.
Project written in a Jupyter Notebook (an open-source web app) where I wrote
scripts in **Python 3** and used the libraries **lXML, SQL Alchemy, Matplotlib,
Keys** and **Pandas** to gather, process and display the data.

## [Analyzing restaurants in Columbus, Ohio](Yelp_API/)
Using Yelp's **RESTful API** — authenticated through **OAuth 2.0** — I analyzed
1000 businesses in Columbus in order to better understand how ratings are
influenced by various different characteristics. Written in a Jupyter Notebook
with **Python 3** scripts using the libraries **requests, json, keys,** and **pandas**.

## [Analyzing Major League Baseball statistics](MLB_stats/)
Another analysis written in a Jupyter Notebook with **Python 3** scripts using
raw **SQL, SQL Alchemy** and **Pandas**, this time in order to see if there are
useful trends that can be uncovered in relation to player statistics.
