# Analyzing Kiva
To view the project, you can either open `kiva.ipynb` (if you have Jupyter) in
the `full_project` directory, or open `kiva.pdf`.

In order to fully replicate the results of this program or make modifications,
you will have to set-up an SQL server (a local server is fine) and create a
keychain to connect to it. You'll have to modify part of the notebook to connect
to your server instead of the server I listed (no longer online).
