It contains data about players, teams, statistics, and more from 1871 up to the present. It contains 27 tables organized into a relational database that can be accessed using SQL. This relational setup makes data easy to access and, more importantly, makes it easy to compare data across different tables.\n",

    "The first thing that we want to see is whether a player's height and weight affect their batting average. Batting average is one way to measure a player's skill and success, so we chose it as the metric with which to compare players of different sizes for this question. However, it is important to note that the weights, heights, and batting averages here are averaged over each player's entire career, so if a player lost weight or got much better over the course of his career, the change would not be reflected well in the graph. Also, players who were only at bat once in their career and hit the ball have a batting average of 0, which may make them appear to be more skilled players than they actually are. This data also excludes data points where a player was never at bat, because it is impossible to calculate a batting average for that point.\n",

    "Both of these scatter plots show fairly similar shapes. Most players are between 66 and 80 inches (5.5-6.67 feet) tall, and most players weigh between about 130 and 240 pounds, so most of the data is between those two ranges. We can also see that most players have a batting average below about 0.40, because most of the data is also consolidated behind that point. There are also a fair number of players with a batting average of 0 (i.e., they never hit a pitch over the course of their career), and some players who have a batting average of 1. However, as was stated before, most of those players were only at bat a couple times in over the course of their career, so their batting averages don't give us as much information. We will ignore these players with batting averages of 1 for the rest of the analysis of these two graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to these graphs, there seems to be a bit of a bottleneck in weight and height when we look at batting averages above 0.40. Up to that point, players are pretty varied in size, but past 0.40, most players tend to be between 68 and 76 inches (5.67-6.3 feet) tall and weigh between 160 and 220 pounds. So, one could possibly conclude that players who are of a more median size, rather than being on the larger or smaller ends, are more likely to have a better batting average. However, this finding could also be a result of the fact that there are more people in general who are in that range of height and weight, so there have been more baseball players in that range, so it would make sense that there are more players with good batting averages in that range. We can conclude, however, that being especially large or especially small does not lend one any particular advantage when it comes to batting average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, there is a clear line at 0.50 in both graphs that seems to show that 0.50 is a fairly common batting average despite the fact that the points on the plot begin to thin out at 0.40. I would guess that this line is caused by a fairly significant number of players only batting several times throughout their career (2-4 times) and getting hits half of that. This brings up another potential issue with these graphs, which is that players who batted more than once but only a couple times over the course of their career may have inflated batting averages."

    "This graph shows us where the highest-paid players are from worldwide. Each player's average salary over their career was taken and use to compute the average salary per country. Greener countries have higher average salaries, while redder countries have lower average salaries. According to this map, the highest-paid players come from Japan, Vietnam, and Cuba, while the lowest-paid players come from Spain, Belgium, and Afghanistan. Baseball is extremely popular in Japan and Cuba, which explains why many high-paid players come from those two countries. There is only one player in Lahman's database who was born in Vietnam - Danny Graves, who actually lived in America for most of his life. This brings up several potential issue with this visualization. First, it does not account for WHERE players grew up and learned baseball - it simply tells us where they were born. This means that some conclusions that could potentially be drawn from this map may be incorrect. For example, one could conclude that baseball is popular in Vietnam and that the country produces many players who are successful in the MLB, when in fact the opposite is true. Second, since the salaries in Lahman's database are most likely not adjusted for inflation, countries in which baseball became popular more recently may appear to have higher-paid players in the MLB. For example, Vietnam's average player salary is so high because Danny Graves played in the 1990's and 2000's, meaning that his average salary is much higher than players from the 1800s or early 1900s. This means that countries that did produce good players for American baseball earlier in its history may have lower average salaries than those that got into it more recently."

Some of the issues with previous graph are not as impactful here, because it is much more likely that all states have had some involvement with baseball for longer than all countries. However, it is still true that many of the salaries in the database are not adjusted for inflation, so that could impact the accuracy of this visualization.\n",

    "For the next question, we wanted to see if teams in different leagues have different overall batting averages.  Lahman's database contains teams from the two current leagues, the American League and the National League, as well as several other now-defunct leagues (the American Association, the Union Association, the Player's League, and the Federal League). I have chosen to only compare teams from only the American League and the National League. The main difference between these two leagues is that the American League allows each team to have a designated hitter who bats instead of the pitcher (since pitchers are often poor batters). This rule was instituted in 1973, so this query only returns data from 1973 to the present so that we can see the effects of this rule. The results are outputted to the file `question3.csv`. The first 10 rows of the `pandas` `DataFrame` created using data from the query are also printed below."

    "First, one may note that the Milwaukee Brewers are present in both tables. The Brewers team was founded in 1969 and was originally a member of the American League, but moved to the National League in 1998. So, the batting average for the Brewers in the American League graph accounts for their playing in 1973-1998, and their batting average in the National League graph accounts for their playing in 1998-2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see in the above graphs that in general, American League teams tend to have higher overall batting averages since 1973 than National League teams do. The American League teams' batting averages sit between 0.195 and 0.235, while the National League teams are between 0.180 and 0.210. Although we don't know what other factors may have affected these teams between 1973 and 2016, it seems as though the designated hitter rule has a pretty big impact on teams' overall batting averages. Since the American League allows for designated hitters, teams can train one player to be an excellent hitter while allowing their pitcher to practice his throwing, which gives them a higher batting average. In contrast, the National League requires pitchers to bat, but since they most likely focus more on becoming a better pitcher than a better hitter, they could bring their teams' batting averages way down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the two different leagues have different rules, what do teams do when they play inter-league games, like in the World Series? The rules have changed several times since the designated hitter rule was instated, but since the 80's the policy has been that the rule is used whenever the game is played in an American League stadium, and is not used when the game is played in a National League stadium."
